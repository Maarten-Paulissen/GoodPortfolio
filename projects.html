          <p>
            This practice exam was about JavaScript. The goal was to test and
            further develop my knowledge and skills in JavaScript. Through
            various exercises, I had the opportunity to practice important
            concepts like functions, objects, and arrays. This practice has
            helped me gain more confidence in my JavaScript skills and better
            prepare for future challenges!

          <h2>Project 2: Hanging man</h2>
          <p>
            Hanging Man is a classic word-guessing game where players try to
            figure out a hidden word by guessing one letter at a time. Each
            incorrect guess brings the player closer to completing the "hanging
            man" drawing. Here's how it works: A word is chosen, and the player
            sees blank spaces representing each letter. The player guesses
            letters to fill in the blanks. Each wrong guess adds a part to the
            hanging man. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the
            hanging man is fully drawn. It's a fun and challenging way to test
            vocabulary and problem-solving skills!
