      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm Maarten Paulissen, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself
        with you. I began my journey as a kindergarten teacher, a role that
        taught me the importance of creativity, patience, and connection. Over
        time, I developed a strong interest in computers and programming,
        sparked by my curiosity about how technology works behind the scenes. As
        I grew older, this passion only deepened, leading me to explore and
        eventually transition into the world of web development. Today, I’m
        proud to call myself a frontend developer, combining my love for
        problem-solving and design to create seamless, user-friendly digital
        experiences. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out if you'd
        like to connect or learn more about my journey!
